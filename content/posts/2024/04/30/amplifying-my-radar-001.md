Well, here is another try at a recurrent blog post (do you remember [Mezcal informal](/2020/09/11/mezcal-informal-0)?), this time, it will be about what I heard, saw, read, or did (maybe).

## Books

Finally, I finished "La historia de España contada para escépticos" by Juan Eslava. It took me almost 3 months, but what I enjoyed the most was the old history of Spain and the era of Franco to "actual" years. I'll post about it soon...

I think it was in this month where I started reading "Getting Started with Enterprise Architecture" by Eric Jager. What a condensed book! I'll focus on ArchMite and how to build/read diagrams of enterprise processes from business to software.

## Words

I like to highlight some words from my day to day. I'll search for a cool way to post a word followed by its meaning. I'm going to start with a wonderful and special word:

> ##### Tsundoku
> A Japanese word for those books that we are not going to read...

Umberto Eco used to call it: antilibrary.

## Music

I've been hearing some dub. Take a beat of this great album; it caught my attention just with that awesome illustration.

## What else?

It's mid-May now, a little bit delayed, sorry not sorry.
